```

Still on progress. Be patient.

## Python Requirements

This tool not compatible with Python 3. I need to migrate this later. So use python v2.7 instead!

## Why Need Root Privilege?

I've try to avoid using Root Privilege, but nmap need Root Privilege. You can add sudo or other way to run nmap without root privilege. It's your choice ;)

Reference -> https://secwiki.org/w/Running_nmap_as_an_unprivileged_user

Don't worry. Belati still running when you are run with normal user ;)
